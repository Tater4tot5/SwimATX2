## 7 Tips for Successfully Sharing a Lap Lane
from http://austinot.com/lap-swimming-austin

  1. Don’t be a lane hog–share.
  2. Look to join a lane of swimmers who seem to share your level of ability.
  3. No surprises. Let swimmers know you are joining their lane.
  4. Swimmers should agree on whether to split the lane (one on each side, works best with two people) or circle swim (down on the left, return on the right, best for more than two swimmers).
  5. To pass, touch a swimmer’s foot to let him/her know you need to come around (it may take a couple of touches). The swimmer will let you move ahead when s/he reaches the next wall.
  6. If someone wants to pass you, stop at the next wall to let him/her move ahead.
  7. Be thoughtful of other swimmers. In a crowded lane, for example, it’s best not to bust out your butterfly.
